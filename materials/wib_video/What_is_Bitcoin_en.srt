00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,546
What is Bitcoin?

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:02,901
Bitcoin is the first

3
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,968
decentralized digital currency.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,138
Bitcoins are digital coins

5
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:07,654
you can send
through the Internet.

6
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:09,333
Compared to other
alternatives,

7
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,388
Bitcoins have a number
of advantages.

8
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:12,523
Bitcoins are transferred

9
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,304
directly from person

10
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,984
to person

11
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:14,744
via the net

12
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,797
without going
through a bank

13
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:16,880
or clearinghouse.

14
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:18,786
This means that the fees
are much lower,

15
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,316
you can use them
in every country,

16
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,706
your account cannot
be frozen

17
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:22,893
and there are no
prerequisites

18
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:23,950
or arbitrary limits.

19
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:27,585
Let's look at how it works!

20
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,880
Bitcoins are generated
all over the Internet

21
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:31,479
by anybody running
a free application

22
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,333
called a Bitcoin miner.

23
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,224
Mining requires a certain
amount of work

24
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,694
for each block of coins.

25
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,250
This amount is
automatically adjusted

26
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:39,249
 by the network

27
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,724
such that Bitcoins
are always created

28
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,310
at a predictable
and limited rate.

29
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:46,370
Your Bitcoins are stored
in your digital wallet

30
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,096
which might look familiar
if you use online banking.

31
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,409
When you transfer Bitcoins,

32
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:52,292
an electronic signature
is added.

33
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,414
After a few minutes

34
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:55,464
the transaction is
verified by a miner

35
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,071
and permanently and
anonymously stored

36
00:00:57,072 --> 00:00:58,237
in the network.

37
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,652
The Bitcoin software is
completely open source

38
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:02,439
and anybody can
review the code.

39
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:04,541
Bitcoin is
changing finance

40
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,607
the same way the web
changed publishing.

41
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,014
When everyone
has access

42
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,060
to a global market,

43
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,966
great ideas flourish.

44
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,198
Let's look at
some examples

45
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,069
of how Bitcoins are
already used today:

46
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,895
You can purchase
video games,

47
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:17,676
gifts,

48
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,474
books,

49
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:19,365
servers

50
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,411
and alpaca socks.

51
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,200
Several currency exchanges exist

52
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,411
where you can trade
your Bitcoins

53
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:24,990
for dollars,

54
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:25,466
euros

55
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,997
and more.

56
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,394
Bitcoins are
a great way

57
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,034
for small businesses
and freelancers

58
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,146
to get noticed.

59
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:32,346
It doesn't cost anything to
start accepting them,

60
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,713
there are no chargebacks or fees

61
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,419
and you'll get
additional business

62
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,774
from the Bitcoin economy.

63
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:39,296
